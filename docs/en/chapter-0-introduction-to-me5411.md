Robot
sensing
allows
robot
to
interact
with
its
environment
•
Two categories of robot sensors:
•
Internal state sensor: detection of arm joint position, for robot
motion control
•
External state sensor: detection of range, distance and touch,
object identification and handling, for robot guidance
•
Vision is most powerful of robot sensory capabilities.

Robotic Vision 
•
Conventional Feature Extraction and Image Classification
•
Features – descriptions of images that can be represented by
some scalar properties (area, perimeter, moments...)
•
Texture features, statistical features – image texture represented
indirectly by non-deterministic properties
•
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)
•
Learning-based Machine Vision
•
Deep Learning for Computer Vision
•
End-to-End: Image of a dog –> Black box –> Husky
•
Condition: the black box is trained (supervised training)
•
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
